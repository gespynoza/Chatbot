# Advanced Chatbot with GPT-3 and Wolfram Alpha
This repository contains the source code for an advanced chatbot that utilizes both OpenAI's GPT-3 API and Wolfram Alpha's API to provide highly accurate responses and solutions to a variety of queries. In addition, we are using Gradio to create a simple and friendly user interface for the chatbot.

The main libraries used in this project are:

* `openai` to interact with GPT-3
* `wolframalpha` to interact with Wolfram Alpha
* `gradio` to create the user interface

## OpenAI
OpenAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) research organization that aims to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) can be deployed safely and its benefits widely shared. It was founded in December 2015 and is based in San Francisco. OpenAI has produced a number of well-known AI models, including GPT-3, the natural language model that this assistant is based on.

The OpenAI API allows developers to use these advanced AI models in their own applications. For example, you can use the OpenAI API to generate text, translate languages, answer questions, and much more.

## Wolfram Alpha
Wolfram Alpha is a computational answer engine and online service created by Wolfram Research. It is known as a "computational knowledge engine" because it can answer factual questions, perform analysis, generate visualizations, and provide data through its own curated database, rather than searching web pages like a traditional search engine.

Wolfram Alpha is capable of responding to a wide range of queries, including mathematics, statistics, physics, chemistry, history, geography, engineering, linguistics, sports, finance, music, and much more. The Wolfram Alpha API allows developers to integrate this powerful functionality into their own applications.

### API Configuration
To use this project, you will need the API keys for OpenAI and Wolfram Alpha. You can obtain these keys by signing up for the respective services.

#### OpenAI
Create an account on OpenAI and save the API key. Make sure to keep it in a safe place and not share it with anyone. You can set the API key in your environment as the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

#### Wolfram Alpha
Create an account on Wolfram Alpha and get your API key. Make sure to keep it in a safe place and not share it with anyone. You can set the API key in your environment as the WOLFRAM_API_KEY environment variable.
